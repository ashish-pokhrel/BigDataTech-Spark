Project Name: Real-time Twitter Analysis with Spark Streaming, HBase, kafka

Introduction
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for real-time Twitter analysis, data storage in HBase, and streaming data processing with Apache Kafka. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to set up, configure, and run a real-time Twitter analysis system using Kafka as the streaming data platform.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

Apache Spark
Apache Flume
HBase
Apache Kafka
Project Structure
The project consists of three main parts:

Spark Streaming Application: Real-time processing and visualization of Twitter data.

HBase Integration: Storing processed data in HBase for historical analysis.

Kafka Integration: Streaming processed data to Kafka for further processing or distribution.

Getting Started
Part 1: Spark Streaming Application
Choose a Twitter API and set up developer credentials.

Configure Apache Flume to collect Twitter data in real-time.

Run the Spark Streaming application to process and visualize Twitter data.

Part 2: HBase Integration
Install and configure HBase on your cluster.

Modify the Spark Streaming application to save processed data to HBase.

Develop a data retrieval mechanism for accessing data stored in HBase.

Part 3: Kafka Integration
Install and configure Apache Kafka on your cluster.

Modify the Spark Streaming application to stream processed data to a Kafka topic.

Create a Kafka consumer to further process or distribute the data as needed.
